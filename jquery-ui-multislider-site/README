JQuery UI component allowing to enhance jQuery-UI slider component to allow multiple handles.

This is based on a project described here : http://www.kelvinluck.com/assets/jquery/ui-slider/slider_test.html
and enhanced with additionnal features :
- Possibility to have more than 2 handles (from kelvinluck's component)
- Handles should be ordered : you won't be able to move an handle after/before another handle (from kelvinluck's component)
- Added a tooltip for value (from kelvinluck's component)
- Removed special cases where there is only one handle (use slider in this case, not multislider)
- Added a tooltip for handle label
- Always displaying tooltips
- Added "frozen" state to disable drag'n'drop on certain handles
- Added odd & even display of tooltip, alternating bottom/top displaying of tooltips
- Tooltips' z-index should always be the higher possible when tooltip is hovered
- Refactored "slide" event compared to jquery-ui slider's "slide" event. In multislider, data passed to this callback is different, and the callback should be able to update other handles if needed (when this is the case, the updatedIndexes array should be updated by the callback)
